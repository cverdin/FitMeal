****
The application FitMeal is used to pull recipesusing an API as well as to calculate your daily calorie needs. 
Currently the recipe query does not provide calorie information. There will need to be a change to this in the future.

To use the app, make sure to agree to the terms.
Then you can go ahead and enter information based on body such as weight and height. 

This will produce your BMR or base metabolic rate which is then used to find calories required.

Finally, use this information to find fitting recipes using RecipePuppy API.
